Udacity Capstoen Project

## Project Definition

### Project Overview
Student provides a high-level overview of the project. Background information such as the problem domain, the project origin, and related data sets or input data is provided.

### Problem Statement
The problem which needs to be solved is clearly defined. A strategy for solving the problem, including discussion of the expected solution, has been made.

### Metrics
Metrics used to measure the performance of a model or result are clearly defined. Metrics are justified based on the characteristics of the problem.
For example, explain why you want to use the accuracy score and/or F-score to measure your model performance in a classification problem,

## Analysis

### Data Exploration
Features and calculated statistics relevant to the problem have been reported and discussed related to the dataset, and a thorough description of the input space or input data has been made. Abnormalities or characteristics about the data or input that need to be addressed have been identified.

### Data Visualization
Build data visualizations to further convey the information associated with your data exploration journey. Ensure that visualizations are appropriate for the data values you are plotting.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
All preprocessing steps have been clearly documented. Abnormalities or characteristics about the data or input that needed to be addressed have been corrected. If no data preprocessing is necessary, it has been clearly justified.

### Implementation
The process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data has been thoroughly documented. Complications that occurred during the coding process are discussed.

### Refinement
The process of improving upon the algorithms and techniques used is clearly documented. Both the initial and final solutions are reported, along with intermediate solutions, if necessary.

## Results

## Conclusion

## Deliverables

### Write-up or Application
If the student chooses to provide a blog post the following must hold: Project report follows a well-organized structure and would be readily understood by a technical audience. Each section is written in a clear, concise and specific manner. Few grammatical and spelling mistakes are present. All resources used to complete the project are cited and referenced.

If the student chooses to submit a web-application, the following holds: There is a web application that utilizes data to inform how the web application works. The application does not need to be hosted, but directions for how to run the application on a local machine should be documented.

### Github Repository
Student must have a Github repository of their project. The repository must have a README.md file that communicates the libraries used, the motivation for the project, the files in the repository with a small description of each, a summary of the results of the analysis, and necessary acknowledgements. If the student submits a web app rather than a blog post, then the Project Definition, Analysis, and Conclusion should be included in the README file, or in their Jupyter Notebook. Students should not use another student's code to complete the project, but they may use other references on the web including StackOverflow and Kaggle to complete the project.
