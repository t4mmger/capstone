# Udacity Capstone Project

## Project Overview
This project is the final part of the Data Science course from Udacity. \
The task is to analyze demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population. We perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company.Â \
Then, we apply what we learned from the segmentation on a third dataset with demographics information for targets of a marketing campaign for the company, and use a model to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company.

## Motivation for Project
My motivation why I chose this project was that you can apply all skills that are need to be a successfull data scientist:
- data wrangling
- unsupervised learning
- supervised learning

## How I approached the problem
data wrangling was about treatment of missing values, dropping rows and columns with too many missing values, identifying outliers. \
unsupervised learning: I used Elbow method to get a good indication of the number of clusters and then used k-means to assign the observations to clusters. Comparisons between customers and population were done with graphics and statistics. For categorical features I chose DBSCAN and plotted them because they were only 2D. In both cases I was able to identify variables that can be used to identify (future) customers.  \
supervised learning: Logistic Regression and XGBoost are compared using AUC. For the better model I do grid search to find the best parameters. 

## Summary of results: 
- I identified differences between the customers and the sample which was representative for Germany.
- This will be useful for a future mailing campaign.
- I estimated several models for predicting if a person responds to a mail. Best was XGBoost.
